# # 2. List of different approaches of how such game can be re-created. You can also use consider the other type of the data than we are providing

# Multiple method could be used:
# 
# 1) data augmentation, noise injection to norm and repeat other param
# 2) Use markov chain to model action, then generate size of list using normal distribution, and generate norm value using normal distribution
# 3) Use markov chain to model action, then generate size of list using normal distribution, and generate norm value using GAN
# 4) Use markov chain to model action, then generate size of list using normal distribution, and generate norm value using LSTM
# 

# # Please fully describe at least one approach you would choose (in jupyter notebook or some additional pdf): 
# ## a. The chosen architecture/algorithm. Why the decision was made, why it makes sense, and what kind of input it assumes. If the mathematical theory for the chosen approach is too complicated, the flow chart is enough.
# ## b. The pre- / post-processing of the data

# A) 
# 
# 
# ## Summary of Solution:
# 
# I employed a multi-pronged approach to model and generate the desired sequences:
# 
# ### 1. **Markov Chain for Action Sequencing**:
# I utilized a Markov chain to model and generate action sequences. This approach ensures that the action labels are generated in a meaningful and coherent order, mimicking real-world scenarios.
# 
# ### 2. **Normal Distribution for List Size Determination**:
# Given the significance of maintaining the gait length, I chose to model the size of the list using a normal distribution. This approach ensures that the generated lengths closely resemble the real-world data distribution.
# 
# ### 3. **LSTM for Norm Value Generation**:
# For the generation of norm values, I deployed an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, which is adept at handling and generating sequences. The LSTM architecture comprised two layers:
# - A layer for norm values: This captures the sequence of previous values.
# - A layer for labels: Recognizing that the norm values are influenced by actions, this layer ensures that the generated norm values are consistent with the associated action labels.
# 
# ## Reflection:
# Upon the completion of this model, I believe that while the LSTM approach has its strengths, there might be areas of potential refinement. Some generated values appear unconventional, indicating the possibility of overfitting or over-complexity. We can delve deeper into these aspects and discuss potential improvements during our interview.

# B)
# 
# 
# 
# Proper preprocessing of the data was essential to prepare it for modeling. The following steps were undertaken:
# - **Encoding Labels**: The action labels were encoded to numerical values, making them suitable for model processing.
# - **Standardizing Norm Values**: To stabilize the LSTM and ensure consistent input, the norm values were standardized. This standardization helps in ensuring smoother training and better performance of the LSTM model.
# 

# 

# # 5. Parametrize your fitted algorithm/program for recreating the game in the following way:
# 
# Bonus: It will be possible to generate game with specific type of play - e.g
# more attacking game (there will be more passes, shots), defending game
# (more tackles, interceptions, etc.), or just normal game.

# ##  1. Adjusting the Markov Chain for Specific Actions:
# To generate specific actions with greater or lesser frequency, the transition probabilities in the Markov chain can be fine-tuned. For instance:
# 
# ### For a Striker: 
# After observing that the probability of a shot post a dribble is 0.09, one could reduce the probabilities of other subsequent actions post-dribble, transferring that proportion to the shooting probability. It's crucial to strike a balance to avoid excessive shooting actions, which may deviate from realistic play.
# 
# ### For a Defender: 
# To simulate defensive actions like tackling with greater frequency, the probabilities of actions like tackling could be increased post certain preceding actions.
# 
# ## 2. Balancing the Coefficients:
# The key challenge lies in adjusting the coefficients in a manner that the generated sequences remain realistic. While emphasizing a specific action, care should be taken to ensure that the player doesn't overly rely on that singular action, as this would distort the authenticity of the gameplay.
