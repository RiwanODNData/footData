    "# Summary of Our Observations (Match 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Action Duration:\n",
    "- Median duration is 0.92 seconds.\n",
    "- 1st quartile: 0.68 seconds; 3rd quartile: 1.16 seconds.\n",
    "- Presence of outliers, with the longest duration being 4.54 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Action Frequency:\n",
    "- 'Walk' is the most frequent (245 occurrences); followed by 'run' (209 occurrences).\n",
    "- Rare actions: 'shot' (6 occurrences) and 'cross' (3 occurrences).\n",
    "- Predominant play style: without ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Norms of Actions:\n",
    "- 'Shot' has the highest mean norm.\n",
    "- Wide norm range for 'shot' and 'dribble'.\n",
    "- 'Walk' and 'rest' showcase lower median norms.\n",
    "- High norm variability in 'shot'.\n",
    "- Several actions exhibit outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Action Duration by sec_time Column:\n",
    "- 'Rest' lasts the longest on average (mean = 1.790).\n",
    "- 'Shot' is the quickest (mean = 0.557).\n",
    "- High variability in 'rest' durations (std = 1.180).\n",
    "- Longest duration: 'rest' (4.54 seconds); shortest burst of action: 'run' (0.02 seconds).\n",
    "- Most frequent action: 'walk' (245 occurrences).\n",

    "## Action Intensity:\n",
    "- High-intensity actions: shots, passes, crosses, tackles.\n",

    "- Normal distribution pattern.\n",
    "- Majority range: 50 to 100, peaking slightly below 100.\n",

    "## Transition Matrix Insights:\n",
    "- Several actions with high self-transition likelihood.\n",
    "- Diverse transitions observed for 'dribble'.\n",
    "- Zero transition probability between some actions, e.g., 'cross' to 'tackle'.\n",
    "- Post 'shot', equal chances to 'walk', 'shot', or 'run'.\n"

    "# Summary of Matches 1 & 2\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Overview\n",
    "Both matches present similar data structure with 'label' and 'norm' columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Action Duration\n",
    "The median action duration is slightly lower in match 2 (0.8s) compared to match 1 (0.92s). Outliers are present in both matches, with match 2 displaying a significantly longer max duration (14.46s vs. 4.54s in match 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Action Distribution\n",
    "Both matches predominantly feature 'walk' and 'run' actions. Match 2 shows an increase in 'shot' actions (12) compared to match 1 (6), yet actions like 'shot' and 'cross' remain rare. Overall, players mostly play without the ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intensity Metrics\n",
    "'Shot' action consistently displays the highest intensity across both matches. The mean and max values for actions like 'run' and 'shot' are closely aligned between the two matches. A consistent person wearing the sensor could be the reason for the similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Action Durations\n",
    "The 'rest' action's average duration is notably longer in match 2 (3.628s) than in match 1 (1.79s), indicating increased fatigue in the second match.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transition Patterns\n",
    "Both matches show high self-transition probabilities, especially for 'walk' and 'run'. Diverse transitions post 'dribble' and consistent post 'shot' transitions are observed in both matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision\n",
    "Given the similarities in intensity, action distribution, and transition patterns, it's deemed beneficial to merge the data from both matches for richer insights and analyses.\n"

    "# Merged Data Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon analyzing the merged dataset, we observed that its structure and characteristics closely resemble those of match 1 and match 2. This is expected since the merged dataset combines the data from both matches and should inherently share the same properties.\n"
