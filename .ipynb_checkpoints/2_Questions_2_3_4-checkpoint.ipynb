    "## Summary of Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "I employed a multi-pronged approach to model and generate the desired sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Markov Chain for Action Sequencing**:\n",
    "I utilized a Markov chain to model and generate action sequences. This approach ensures that the action labels are generated in a meaningful and coherent order, mimicking real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Normal Distribution for List Size Determination**:\n",
    "Given the significance of maintaining the gait length, I chose to model the size of the list using a normal distribution. This approach ensures that the generated lengths closely resemble the real-world data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **LSTM for Norm Value Generation**:\n",
    "For the generation of norm values, I deployed an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, which is adept at handling and generating sequences. The LSTM architecture comprised two layers:\n",
    "- A layer for norm values: This captures the sequence of previous values.\n",
    "- A layer for labels: Recognizing that the norm values are influenced by actions, this layer ensures that the generated norm values are consistent with the associated action labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reflection:\n",
    "Upon the completion of this model, I believe that while the LSTM approach has its strengths, there might be areas of potential refinement. Some generated values appear unconventional, indicating the possibility of overfitting or over-complexity. We can delve deeper into these aspects and discuss potential improvements during our interview."

    "- **Standardizing Norm Values**: To stabilize the LSTM and ensure consistent input, the norm values were standardized. This standardization helps in ensuring smoother training and better performance of the LSTM model.\n"

    "##  1. Adjusting the Markov Chain for Specific Actions:\n",
    "To generate specific actions with greater or lesser frequency, the transition probabilities in the Markov chain can be fine-tuned. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "### For a Striker: \n",
    "After observing that the probability of a shot post a dribble is 0.09, one could reduce the probabilities of other subsequent actions post-dribble, transferring that proportion to the shooting probability. It's crucial to strike a balance to avoid excessive shooting actions, which may deviate from realistic play.\n",

    "The key challenge lies in adjusting the coefficients in a manner that the generated sequences remain realistic. While emphasizing a specific action, care should be taken to ensure that the player doesn't overly rely on that singular action, as this would distort the authenticity of the gameplay."
